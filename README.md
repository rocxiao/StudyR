# StudyR

The materails are based on the book R for Everyone Advanced Analytics and Graphics written by Jared P. Lander. 

All of the materials are written in Rmarkdown, and in pdf format. 

The book is a wonderful introduction for those who know little about R(like myself). And I find it's very rewarding after go over the examples in this book.
